# Introduction #

MTG Companion provides several features to make life easier for players. These features include:
  * Basic life counter
    * Support for adding/subtracting arbitrary values
  * Card look-up, using the Wizards of the Coast Gatherer website


# Instructions #

## Life Counter ##
The default life for this application is 20. Currently, this cannot be modified. In order to increase the current life by one, press the add button (+). In order to reduce the current life by one, press the subtract button (-). If you wish to add or subtract a larger number from your life, hold down the add or subtract button, and enter the amount in the prompt that appears.

When a game is finished, you can reset your life by pressing **Menu** and pressing the **Reset Life** button. Similarly, if you wish to set your life to a specific value without adding or subtracting, press the **Menu** button, the press **Set Life** and enter the amount of life you wish.

## Card Lookup ##
MTG Companion allows card look-ups via the Wizards of the Coast's Gatherer website. In order to access the card look up, press **Menu**, and press **Card Search**. Enter the name of the card you wish to look up, and press the **Search** button to open the website.

In future versions, the card look-up may be streamlined. If this occurs, the browser will not be launched - instead the card information will be displayed in MTG Companion.
